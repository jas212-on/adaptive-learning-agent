The rest of those genes tell us everything from our eye color to whether we're predisposed to certain diseases. The genetic similarity between a human and a human is: 99.9% Key Molecules of Life Proteins and Amino Acids: Proteins are large (macro) molecules continuously manufactured by the cells and the instructions to produce them are stored in the DNA. Sequence of three RNA nucleotides are called codons that corresponds…"

    "summary": "Here's a summary of the captured content:\n\n*   Molecular biology involves analyzing various types of data generated from cells.\n*   Key data types include DNA sequences, RNA sequences, and protein sequences.\n*   Microarray images represent another important type of data in molecular biology.\n*   DNA, RNA, and protein sequences are essentially text data (strings).\n*   These sequence data can be viewed and opened using a standard text editor.\n*   Microarray data, unlike sequences, are digital images."

    "summary": "Here's a summary of the key concepts:\n\n*   All living organisms are fundamentally composed of cells.\n*   The three key molecules essential for life are DNA, RNA, and Proteins.\n*   The cell's nucleus serves as the central core, housing the critical DNA molecule.\n*   DNA is packaged into structures called chromosomes.\n*   DNA is a double-stranded molecule that stores genetic information.\n*   DNA is built from four types of nucleotide molecules: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T)."
