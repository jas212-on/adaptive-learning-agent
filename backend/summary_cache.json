The rest of those genes tell us everything from our eye color to whether we're predisposed to certain diseases. The genetic similarity between a human and a human is: 99.9% Key Molecules of Life Proteins and Amino Acids: Proteins are large (macro) molecules continuously manufactured by the cells and the instructions to produce them are stored in the DNA.
