    "summary": "Here's a summary of the captured content:\n\n*   The program initializes a `visited` array to keep track of nodes encountered during graph traversal.\n*   It takes input for the number of vertices (`n`) and the graph's structure, likely represented by an adjacency matrix.\n*   A Depth First Search (DFS) function is called, passing parameters such as the current node, a parent node (indicated by `-1`), the `visited` array, the graph data, and the total number of vertices.\n*   The core logic involves checking the return value of the DFS function to determine the presence of a cycle.\n*   Upon completion of the cycle detection process, the program prints a message indicating whether a cycle exists in the graph."
