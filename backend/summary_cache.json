    "summary": "Here's a summary of the captured content:\n\n*   **Purpose of Regex Validation:** Regular Expressions (Regex) ensure that captured text (manual or automatic) adheres to a predefined, official pattern.\n*   **Data Integrity:** This validation step is crucial before integrating data with backend services to maintain data quality and prevent errors.\n*   **Applications in Vehicle Management:** Regex is commonly used in various real-world systems related to vehicles.\n*   **Toll Plazas:** Validating captured license plates against patterns before checking Fastag databases.\n*   **Traffic Police Apps:** Ensuring correct vehicle number input by officers, preventing wrong searches against insurance or road tax databases.\n*   **Parking Systems:** Validating OCR results from ANPR cameras to match against registered user patterns.\n*   **Database Integration:** Regex can be integrated into database schemas using `CHECK` constraints (e.g., in SQL `CREATE TABLE`) to enforce pattern rules directly on data fields like `LicenseNo`."

    "summary": "Here's a summary of the captured content:\n\n*   The program initializes a `visited` array to keep track of nodes encountered during graph traversal.\n*   It takes input for the number of vertices (`n`) and the graph's structure, likely represented by an adjacency matrix.\n*   A Depth First Search (DFS) function is called, passing parameters such as the current node, a parent node (indicated by `-1`), the `visited` array, the graph data, and the total number of vertices.\n*   The core logic involves checking the return value of the DFS function to determine the presence of a cycle.\n*   Upon completion of the cycle detection process, the program prints a message indicating whether a cycle exists in the graph."
