    "overview": "Genetic information flow describes the fundamental processes by which genetic instructions encoded in DNA are expressed to build and maintain an organism. It primarily involves the transfer of information from DNA to RNA (transcription) and then from RNA to protein (translation). This concept, along with DNA replication, forms the basis of the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, illustrating how hereditary information guides cellular function.",
    "prerequisites": [
      "Basic understanding of cell structure (nucleus, cytoplasm, ribosomes)",
      "Knowledge of DNA as the genetic material and its double helix structure",
      "Familiarity with RNA as a nucleic acid molecule",
      "Basic concept of proteins and their diverse functions",
      "Understanding of nitrogenous bases (Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine, Uracil)",
      "The idea of genes carrying hereditary information"
    ],
    "keyIdeas": [
      "Replication:** DNA makes copies of itself, ensuring genetic continuity during cell division.",
      "Transcription:** The genetic code from a DNA segment is copied into a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule.",
      "Translation:** Ribosomes use the mRNA sequence to synthesize a specific protein, guided by transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA).",
      "Central Dogma:** The primary flow of genetic information is generally from DNA to RNA to Protein.",
      "The genetic code defines how sequences of three mRNA nucleotides (codons) correspond to specific amino acids.",
      "Each type of RNA (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA) plays a distinct and crucial role in protein synthesis.",
      "This directional flow ensures that genetic instructions stored in DNA are accurately converted into functional proteins."

    "pitfalls": [
      "Confusing the distinct processes of replication, transcription, and translation.",
      "Assuming genetic information always flows strictly from DNA to RNA to protein without exceptions (e.g., retroviruses and reverse transcriptase).",
      "Not understanding the specific roles of mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA in protein synthesis.",
      "Overlooking the crucial role of DNA replication in heredity and cell proliferation.",
      "Mistaking the genetic code for the sequence of bases itself, rather than the set of rules for translating mRNA into amino acids.",
      "Forgetting that not all RNA molecules are translated into proteins (e.g., rRNA, tRNA, regulatory RNAs)."
